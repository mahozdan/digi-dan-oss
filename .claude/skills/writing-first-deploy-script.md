Generate a first deploy script (it can be as long as needed, scripts are not limited to 300 lines), it should be a cli wizard leading the deploy step by step, you should do ALL actions you can do by yourself using aws cli or .sh scripts that will support the process. Only actions that include secrets or tokens should be done manually - never manage tokens or secets in the scripts. If an action can be done by copying a command to the wsl console it should be done in a bash script. Make sure to run commands with expected output to validate each and every step. Output status and progress to the user. Script should prepare for sad flows such as a second run where some resources have already been provisioned, malformed actions requiring fixing etc. Write the script and document it's steps and actions in an .md file
