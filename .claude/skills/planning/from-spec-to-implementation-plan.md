## This guide explains the steps and artifacts requried to move from a plan file to an implementation-plan file

- When prompt by the user to create an implementation plan:
- [ ] Read the xx.plan.md file and understand it thourouly. Then create:
    - [ ] A new xxx.user-stories.md file which specifies all user stories drived from this plan
    -[ ] A new xxx.acceptance-criteria.md file which specifies all acceptance ctriteria derived from the plan and the user stories
    - [ ] A new xxx.test-plan.md file which specifies all the required unit test, integration tests and e2e tests to cover the functionality required in the previous steps and plan
    - [ ] A new xxx.implementation-plan.md file which takes all of the above and orgenizes them into a phased and checklisted plan to be executed. This should be a clean document only for follwoing on progress

- Make sure the implementation plan is phased in a way that demonstrate progress from phase to phase and that is testable
